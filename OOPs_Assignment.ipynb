        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - OOP is a programming approach that focuses on using objects and classes for organizing code. It helps in modeling real-world entities and managing large projects easily.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint or template that defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) which are shared by its objects. It helps in creating multiple objects with similar features.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class which has its own data and behavior. It is created using the class and represents real-world entities like a car, student, etc.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction hides the internal details and shows only essential features to users, while encapsulation binds data and methods into a single unit and restricts direct access.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder (Double Underscore) methods are special methods like _init_(), _str_(), _len_() which start and end with double underscores. They define the behavior of objects.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance allows one class (child class) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent class). It promotes code reusability and supports hierarchical classification.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism means using a single function name or operator to perform different tasks based on the type of object or input given.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is achieved by making variables private using __ or _ and accessing them through getter and setter methods to protect data from unauthorized access.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor is a special method in Python called _init_() which is automatically executed when an object of a class is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Class methods use @classmethod decorator and access class variables using cls. Static methods use @staticmethod and do not access class or instance variables.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading means creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python does not directly support it but can achieve it using default or variable arguments.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding means redefining the parent class method in the child class with the same name and parameters to change or extend its functionality.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - A property decorator @property is used to convert class methods into read-only properties and control access to class attributes using getter and setter.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism increases flexibility, improves code readability, and allows the same function or method to work in different ways depending on the object.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class is a class with at least one abstract method (using @abstractmethod). It cannot be instantiated directly and forces derived classes to implement abstract methods.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - OOP offers benefits like code reusability, easy debugging, real-world modeling, better data security, and maintainability of code.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - Class variables are shared by all objects of a class, while instance variables are unique to each object and are defined using self.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit features from more than one parent class. It helps in combining properties of multiple classes into one.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ''_ _str_ _' and '_ _repr_ _'' methods in Python.\n",
        "  - _ _str_ _ returns a readable string for end-users, while _ _repr_ _ returns a developer-friendly string useful for debugging.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function is used to call the parent class methods from the child class. It helps in accessing inherited methods easily.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the _ _del_ _ method in Python?\n",
        "  - _ _del_ _ is a destructor method which is called automatically when an object is deleted or garbage collected to perform clean-up actions.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - Static methods use @staticmethod and don't access class or object data. Class methods use @classmethod and access class variables using cls.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - In inheritance, polymorphism allows child classes to define their own version of the methods present in the parent class, changing the behavior as needed.\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line because each method returns the object itself (self).\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the _ _call_ _ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The _ _call_ _ method allows an object to be called like a function, enabling the object to behave like a callable function.\n"
